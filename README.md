As a development team, you have been asked by a local Nashville museum to create an app for them that engages patrons.  The app's concept is that museum staff can add attractions, exhibits, and events while patrons can save/like, and comment on the content.  

There are several museums to choose from in Nashville, but no two groups can do the same museum.  Reserve your spot in the Slack thread for the museum you want.  Some possibilities are below, but feel free to ask about ones not on this list. 

- Zoo
- Adventure Science Center
- TN State Museum
- Cheekwood
- Ryman
- Country Music Hall of Fame
- The Frist
- National Museum of African American Music
- Country Music Hall of Fame

### Requirements

- The app should have a least 2 users types, staff and patrons.
- Staff should be able to view, edit, post and delete attractions, events, and exhibits.
- Patrons should be able to view attractions, events, and exhibits.
- Patrons should be able to like or save an attraction, event, or exhibit.  When saved, this should be specific to the patron.
- Patrons should be able to view a list of their saved/liked content.
- Patrons should be able to unsave/unlike content
- Patrons should be able to comment on an attraction, event, or exhibit.  Comments should be public.
- Patrons should be able to view comments on an attraction, event, or exhibit

### Bonuses

- A patron can like another person's comment
- A patron can edit and delete their own comments
- Staff can block or delete comments
- Patrons have the ability to ask a question and staff can respond.
- Filtering of content by
    - attraction, event, or exhibit
    - date added (or happening)
    - most comments
    - most likes









# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
